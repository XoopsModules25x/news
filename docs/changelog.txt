<h5>1.50</h5>
<hr>

- I have added a block to show archives (and two new files /xoops/modules/news/blocks/news_archives.php
  and /xoops/modules/news/templates/blocks/news_block_archives.html)
  This block should be visible on Xoops France
- Addition of on the fly blocks (all the blocks are coming with a "on_the_fly"
  function). For example, if you create a custom PHP block with the following
  content, you will see the "Archives" block :
    include_once(XOOPS_ROOT_PATH . '/modules/news/blocks/news_archives.php');
    b_news_archives_onthefly('1|2004|4|2006|8|1');

- Corrected a bug in the random articles block (the html tags was visible)
- The page used to list articles from the same author will now shows you a total
  of articles and reads per topic.
- Added a new feature in the module's options "FootNotes".
  This option is used for printable versions of your articles.
  When activated, you can see, in the page's footer a table with links from
  your document. For more information, see this links :
    http://www.alistapart.com/articles/improvingprint/
    http://www.easy-designs.net/code/footnoteLinks/
  Don't forget to print or to preview your document to be able to see the links !
- A </head> tag was missing in the printable version of an article
- In print.php, the document's type was changed from Html 4 to xHtml

  cache)

- I have removed the static word "Page" from the templates (and added it to the
  translations).
- Inside article.php, you can now use the following Smarty variables :
    <{$story.poster_avatar}>
    <{$story.poster_signature}>
    <{$story.poster_email}>
    <{$story.poster_url}>
    <{$story.poster_from}>
- I have added a link, in the module's administration, to maintain the module's
  tables. This will optimize, check and analyze the tables in the database.
- I have added a new option to activate Dublin Core Metadata in the article's
  page. For more explanations, see http://dublincore.org/
  Dublin Core Metadata are, as the name state, a set of metadatas used to
  describe your documents.
  If you are a Firefox user, you can use this extension to visualize the Dublin
  Metadata :
    https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/528/
- You can display a "Bookmark this article at these sites" on the article's page
    To see an example, look at the bottom of this article :
    http://ajax.phpmagazine.net/2006/11/ajaxcore_new_php_framework_rel.html
- You can use Firefox 2 Micro summaries : http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries
  If someone bookmarks your page with Firefox 2 they can choose to see the last
  title of your last news instead of the current page's title.
  The News module modifies the metadatas of all its page to include a line
  like this one :
  <link rel="microsummary" href="http://www.example.com/modules/news/micro_summary.php" />
  but you can also add it in your theme so that when someone bookmark your site
  from any page they can get your micro summary.
  With FireFox 2, you can use this extension :
      https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3639/
- You have a new page called "Who's who" showing your visitors a list or the
  authors of the site (this page is only visible if you have activated the
  "news by this author" option)
  This page can be seen from the Xoops menu (or directly to /modules/news/whoswho.php)
- A complete new metagen. You can select the number of generated meta keywords,
  select the keywords order and manage a blacklist. Blacklisted words will not
  be used for the keywords.
- You have a new page to display a topics directory ("Topics Directory)
  You can access it from the standard Xoops menu or directly from
  http://www.example.com/modules/news/topics_directory.php
- You can display advertisements in your articles.
  There is a new module option that you can use for this.
  Everything that you type is rendered in the module's templates.
  In the page used to see a full article (article.php), the advertisement is
  shown between the Scoop and the extended text.
  In all the other pages, you have a Smarty tag called <{$advertisement}- that
  you can place where you want.
- You can manage topics permissions from the topic's form (in the module's
  administration) while you are creating or editing a topic.
- You can enter the authorized mime types to join files in the module's options.
  Enter all the mimetypes you want separated by a new line.
- In the module's administration, where you can create a newsletter's content,
  you can now select to remove html tags and you can add an header and a footer.
- In your articles, you can now replace the syntax used to separate pages with
  a new one (thanks Bender)
  To be able to use it, you must, in the modules option, select the suitable
  option ("Use enhanced page navigator?")
  Then, to use it, inside your articles, you can separate pages like this
  (imagine this is the content or your article) :
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit,
    [pagebreak: Here is my page 2]
    sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam.
    Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper
    nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
    [pagebreak: This is the development]
    Duis autem vel eum iriure dolor in hendrerit in vulputate velit esse,
    vel illum dolore eu feugiat nulla facilisis at vero eros et
    [pagebreak: Conclusion]
    accumsan et iusto odio dignissim qui blandit praesent luptatum zzril
    delenit augue duis dolore te feugait nulla facilisi.

  Notes :
    - The old syntax ([pagebreak]) is still available
    - Your text inside the brackets DOES NOT HAVE TO CONTAIN [ or ]
    - The syntax is not case sensitive

  You can also, now, use, inside your articles, the new "meta variable" [summary].
  This will automatically create a summary by using the pages titles you gave in
  the [pagebreak] "tag".

    If you want to change this limit, edit the file /xoops/modules/news/include/functions.php and find this line :
    $tmp=array_slice($tmp,0,20);    // If you want to change the limit of keywords, change this number from 20 to what you want
- You can import your articles from AMS 2.41.
  To do it, launch http://www.example.com/modules/news/admin/amsimport.php
  You must be a module's administrator to launch this script.
  The script imports topics, articles, files, links, ratings, comments and notifications from Ams WITHOUT removing *anything* from it.
  The only thing you have to do is to recreate the permissions.
  WARNING, Once you have imported your articles from Ams, if you delete a news in the News module and if this article have some attached
  files, they will be also deleted in Ams !
  You can launch this script as many times as you want but this will create as many news and topics as you launch the script
  The imported article is always the last version in Ams

<h5>1.31 RC2</h5>
<hr>
Corrections :
- There was a bug int the "randon news" block when you was selecting to use only one or zero stories (thank you domifara)

- When you was using the standard dhtml Xoops editor in the Topics Manager, you was not able to use the editor's buttons (thank you eric_juden)

Additions/Changes :
- I have added, in the module's index page and in the article's page, two new Smarty vars :
        topic_title - Wich will only contains the news topic (with a ilnk)
        news_title - Wich will only contains the news title (with a link)
 This will respond to the often asked question, "how to remove the topic's title from the news title.
 It's available in the module's index page and in the article's page.
 Suggestion made by ralf57
- In the index page, when you was viewing a topic and where there were no articles inside it, nothing was visible. Now you can see, at least
  and if you have selected it, the navigation's bar
- In the part wich is responsible to generate keywords automatically, I have added an "option" so that the default keywords defined in the
  preferences are returned when the module can't compute any keyword.
- In the topics manager, by default the topics was created as a submenu of the "News" item, that's not the case anymore

  then the module will generate them automatically (like smartsection but with my own "engine" ;-) ).
- The module is capable to detect when a bot is reading the news to generate links to every pages from the module's index page.
  It can also generate links for every pages of an article.
  Idea suggested by xoops-tips and multimenu from Solo71, thank you both !
- The module can search inside the articles comments (and it respects the permissions).
  If you don't want to use this feature, edit the file called /xoops/modules/news/include/search.inc.php and replace this line :
    $searchincomments=true;
  with :
    $searchincomments=false;
- I have modified the files called /xoops/pda.php and /xoops/backend.php. They will now respect the permissions and will display the
  same number of news that the module's option called "Select the number of news items to display on top page"
