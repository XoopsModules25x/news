    <h4 class="odd">How to install News</h4><br>
    <p class="even">

        News is installed as a regular XOOPS module, which means you should copy
        the
        complete /news folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then
        log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look
        for the News icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the
        install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to
        go.<br><br>
        Detailed instructions on installing modules are available in the
        <a href="https://xoops.gitbook.io/xoops-operations-guide/" target="_blank">XOOPS Operations Manual</a>
        <br><br>

        Please verify that the modules\News\images\topics directory is writable
        on the
        server (read+write e.g. chmod=777).<br><br>

        After having created your first topic (category), and before creating
        your first
        article/news, you need to click on Permission Tab to set groups
        permissions.<br><br></p>
